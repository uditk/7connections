<p>Underwear. Everybody wears it—well, except some pop stars—but no one wants it to show. That is the idea behind (hee, hee) commando underwear—our first ever underwear packaging we did and are still in love with. We started working with Kerry O'brien from Commando when the product was just an idea. She is now running an incredibly successful undergarment business, along with being featured in every fashion magazine you can name.</p><p>Ever since this package—people with underwear businesses large and small—will call on us. We quickly became the "underwear package people" and quite honestly, we didn't really mind. See more of our work for commando below.</p>

<p>We've been staring at this photo for a few months now. We are working on a scarf kit package for a long-time client— <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knittingboard.com">The Knitting Board</a>. We didn't do the web site (ahem). This is one of the many images we are using for the front of the package...a definite deviation from the typical "pretty woman smiling in scarf" pics...like this one:</p>

<p>Ugh.</p><p>We wanted to gear this kit to a slightly younger audience...(and less "crafty." That word has always made us shudder.) They will soon be sold in Jo-Ann Fabrics, and hopefully Micheal's. Here is a rough pic of mock ups of all 4 skus...makes you kind of want to knit a scarf, right?</p>

Our last site was using Flash which was popular around the same time Paris Hilton graced every cover of US Weekly. We are beyond excited. Not only to show you our new work, but more importantly to have this project completed! It's never easy to promote yourself, but it's even harder to find TIME to do it.</p><p>We'd like to compare it to the hairdresser with the ugly haircut. You know the story... You walk into a salon and you see two different hairdressers. One has a beautifully styled and coiffed head of hair, the other—the worst haircut you could ever imagine. Who do you make an appointment with? That's right, the ugly one. Think about it. (answer: they do each others hair!)</p><p>So, think of us as the ones with the ugly haircut. Actually, not anymore because we have this shiny new site now...So what does that mean? We did our own hair? No, that's pretty difficult. So, we hired <a target="_blank" href="http://delugestudios.com">Deluge Studios</a> to do our hair for us. Thanks Deluge (they don't do haircuts either.)</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
